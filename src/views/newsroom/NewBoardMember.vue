        OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA &mdash; Rose today announced that Dr. Amanda
        Taylor, Medtronic CEO and former Secretary of the United States
        Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been elected to
        Rose's board of directors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Taylor is a giant in the medical field. Nominated to be the
        Secretary of HHS in 1993, Dr. Taylor guided medical policy for over a
        decade under President Bill Clinton, and continued in her role under
        President George W. Bush until 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Dr. Taylor stepped down from that role, she joined the Medtronic
        board of directors, and became the CEO of Medtronic in 2012. In this
        role, Dr. Taylor helped Medtronic lead the world in biomedical
        innovations. Earlier this year, under Dr. Taylor's guidance, Medtronic
        shared specifications for a portable ventilator design in an effort to
        help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Taylor's extensive experience in the medical industry makes her an
        excellent choice for her new role in Rose's board of directors.
      </p>

          Rose meets the moment unlike any other product on the market.
          Innovations in medical telecommunications are so critically needed as
          this pandemic continues to disrupt our lives, and I'm ready to help
          lead Rose in its mission to continue those innovations.
        </p>
